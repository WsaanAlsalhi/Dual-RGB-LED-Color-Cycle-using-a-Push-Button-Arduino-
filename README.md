# Dual-RGB-LED-Color-Cycle-using-a-Push-Button-Arduino-
This project allows you to control **two RGB LEDs** using a **single button**. Each press of the button toggles the LEDs between ON (showing a specific color) and OFF. When turning ON again, the color advances to the next one in a predefined sequence.
